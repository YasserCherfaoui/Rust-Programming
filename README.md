# Rust Programming
## Overview 
This repo is my journey to learn Rust Programming. Here, you will find all the small projects I have made so far.

## Resources
I am a self-paced learner, and I like reading documentation and books more than watching videos, or buying courses. Why? The average person should be able to read between 200 and 300 Word/Minute. Meanwhile, people speak about 140 words per minute. So it is time-consuming to watch videos. Enough talk here goes the list of Books I read:
- The Rust Programming Language ( The book that comes with rustup, you can access it this way).

- Programming Rust, 2nd Edition (ISBN: 1492052590).
